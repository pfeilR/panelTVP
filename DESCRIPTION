Description: This package contains functions for flexible Bayesian inference
 in panel studies, where Gaussian, binary and (zero-inflated) count variables
 can be analyzed in a regression setting. The model is flexible in the sense
 that parameters are allowed to vary over time. Moreover, shrinkage priors 
 are used to prevent overfitting and to identify whether an effect is 
 time-varying time-invariant or zero. Missing values in the response variable
 are imputed during MCMC estimation.
