Description: This package contains functions for flexbile Bayesian inference in balanced panel studies,
 where Gaussian, binary and (zero-inflated) response variables can be analyzed in a regression setting.
 The model is flexible in the sense that parameters are allowed to vary over time. Moreoever,
 shrinkage priors are used to prevent overfitting and to identify whether an effect is time-varying
 time-invariant or zero.
